# STAT423
The distance of launch for a small soft
projectile from a slingshot was studied. The
distance to pull the slingshot back and the
angle from the ground to launch the
projectile from were considered. The
optimal combination of these two was
desired to maximize the launch distance of
the projectile. A second order model was
obtained to predict launch distance as a
function of pull distance and launch angle.
Both were found to have a positive effect on
launch distance. Optimal settings for pull
distance were found to be in the range of 4
to 6 inches, and optimal settings for launch
angle were found to be in the range of 40 to
50 degrees.
